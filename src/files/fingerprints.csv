# This file contains information about what specific fingerprint plots you want to make.
# If nothing about a central group is in here only the 'closest atom' plot will be made.
# Make sure to fill in each column choosing the labels that you are interesting.
# If you don't remember the labels that your molecule has: try plotting the model fragment (with labels).
#
# The columns are defined as follows:
# central: the name of the central group
# description: describe what atoms you have used in this plot
# labels: labels of the atoms to use separated by '&'
